# Library Book Checkout System (Late Fees Calculator)

This project is a C++ program that models a basic library book borrowing system. Users of the application can determine the cost of returning books late and get to know the library's basic information through a menu-based interface.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
This project involves developing a Library Book Checkout System using C++. The program is designed to calculate late return fees for overdue library books and provide basic library information through a menu-driven interface. The objective of this task is to apply fundamental C++ programming concepts such as functions, conditional statements, and loops to create a functional and user-friendly console application.

---

## 📝 Purpose
This program tests the ability to:

- Design a menu-driven C++ application
- Implement functions with parameters and return values
- Apply conditional logic for tier-based calculations
- Handle user input and output correctly
- Control program flow using loops

This exercise strengthens problem-solving skills and reinforces core C++ fundamentals.

## 💎 Overview

The Library Book Checkout System allows users to:
- Calculate late fees based on the number of overdue days
- Display basic library information
- Navigate the system using a menu-based interface
- Repeat operations until the user chooses to exit

The system applies different late fee rates depending on the length of the overdue period.

---

## 💡 Objective of the Program

The main objectives of this program are to:
- Accurately calculate late fees using a tiered fee structure
- Ensure clear separation of tasks using modular functions
- Validate user choices through menu selection
- Maintain smooth program execution using a loop

The goal of this project is not to build a complex system, but to correctly implement logic that reflects real-world library late fee rules.

## 💰 Late Fee Structure
| Overdue Days | Charges |
|--------------|---------|
| 1 – 7 days | RM 0.50 per day |
| 8 – 14 days	| RM 1.00 per day |
| 15+ days | RM 2.00 per day |

The total fee is calculated cumulatively based on these tiers.
